# 3DGalaxyCollisionSimulation_MOND

The simulation applies Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) to galaxy rotation.
It effectively models a flat galaxy rotation curve due to dark matter, making it useful for simulating actual cosmic environments.
The simulation determines the initial positions and velocities of two galaxies to simulate a collision.

Using the Runge-Kutta method, it simplifies the complexity by assuming that each star in the galaxies interacts only with its own galaxy's black hole and the black hole of the colliding galaxy.
Therefore, this simulation can run on an ordinary laptop.
